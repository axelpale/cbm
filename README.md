Some years ago I saw a documentary related to happiness. In the program
psychologists used a program to display multiple faces to participants. One of
the faces was having a happy emotion and the others were unhappy. The task was
to find the happy face. This was called cognitive bias modification.

Here is a simple website-program doing it with JS.

## usage
Download and run on web-browser. Currently you need to add urls of face-images
manually to the code.
